## USER STORY

AS AN employer 

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

--- 

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

## DESCRIPTION

A portfolio of my works, build for my UW Coding Bootcamp. This webpage was built to contain a header, nav bar, main and footer. The main section is broken into three sections to display "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact Me" sections. 

The webpage is built with flexbox to be able to have a responsive layout to any screensize. Additionally, there is styling to make the webpage mobile friendly!

## USAGE

This webpage is meant to function and be viewed entirely in browser. The anchors all function to direct users to the various sections of the webpage or to external sources. Moreover, all anchors have been coded to change their styling when they're in their "focus," "hover," and "active" states to make the webpage easier to navigate.
